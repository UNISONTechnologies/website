            By using the Services provided by UNISON Technologies in any way,
            these terms will automatically apply to you, therefore you should
            make sure that you read them carefully before using the Services.
            You are not allowed to copy or modify any part of the Service, or
            our trademarks, in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract
            the source code of the Service, unless it is open-source, and you
            also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages (<a

            if you would like to translate a Service), or make derivative
            versions. The Services themselves, and all the trademarks,
            copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights
            related to it, still belong to UNISON Technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
            UNISON Technologies is committed to ensuring that the Services are
            as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the
            right to make changes to the Services or to charge for its services,
            at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for any of
            the Services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
            paying for.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Services use third party services that declare their own Terms
            and Conditions.

        <p>
            You should be aware that there are certain things that UNISON
            Technologies will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of
            the Services will require the Services to have an active internet
            connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile
            network provider, but UNISON Technologies cannot take responsibility
            for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have
            access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you’re using a Service outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
            remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
            provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
            mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
            connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. By
            using the Services, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
            charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Services
            outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without
            turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
            device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume
            that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the
            Services.
        </p>

        <p>
            Along the same lines, UNISON Technologies cannot always take
            responsibility for the way you use the Services i.e. You need to
            make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery
            and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, UNISON Technologies
            cannot accept responsibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            With respect to UNISON Technologies’s responsibility for your use of
            the Services, when you’re using the Services, it’s important to bear
            in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
            correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
            information to us so that we can make it available to you. UNISON
            Technologies accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
            you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality
            of the app.
        </p>

        <p>
            At some point, we may wish to update the Services. UNISON
            Technologies does not promise that it will always update the app so
            that it is relevant to you and/or works with the software that you
            have installed on your device. However, in order for the app to have
            the latest features and bug fixes, you must accept updates to the
            application when offered to you, we may also wish to stop providing
            the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
            notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
            termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
            terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
            delete it from your device.
