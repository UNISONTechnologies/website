I"Ø<p>By using the Services provided by UNISON Technologies in any way, these terms will automatically apply to you â€“ you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the Services. Youâ€™re not allowed to copy, or modify the Servuce, any part of the Servuce, or our trademarks in any way. Youâ€™re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the Service, unless it is open-source, and you also shouldnâ€™t try to translate the app into other languages (contact UNISON Technologies if you would like to port a Service to another language), or make derivative versions. The Services themselves, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to UNISON Technologies.</p>

<p>UNISON Technologies is committed to ensuring that the Services are as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the Services or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for any of the Services without making it very clear to you exactly what youâ€™re paying for.</p>

<p>The Services use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://umami.is/">Umami</a> (an anonymous, open-source, privacy-focused analytics platform)</li>
  <li><a href="https://sentry.io/terms/">Sentry</a> (an error-logging platform)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that UNISON Technologies will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the Services will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but UNISON Technologies cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you donâ€™t have access to Wi-Fi, and you donâ€™t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, youâ€™re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which youâ€™re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, UNISON Technologies cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged â€“ if it runs out of battery and you canâ€™t turn it on to avail the Service, UNISON Technologies cannot accept responsibility.</p>

<p>With respect to UNISON Technologiesâ€™s responsibility for your use of the app, when youâ€™re using the app, itâ€™s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. UNISON Technologies accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

<p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android â€“ the requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and youâ€™ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. UNISON Technologies does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
